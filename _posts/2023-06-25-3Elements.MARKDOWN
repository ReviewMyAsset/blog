The 3 Key Elements of Investing:

When making any investment decision, it is essential to consider the following three key elements:

1.	Goal/Objective: Every investment should be tied to a specific objective. The success of an investment should be measured by the achievement of the intended goal, rather than focusing solely on earning a certain percentage of returns. Saving and sacrificing current income should be purposeful, driven by the objective you have set. For example, the joy and satisfaction of purchasing a car that you planned and saved for a year are far greater than random investments made without considering the purpose. Identifying your goals serves two purposes: it motivates you to work towards them, and it helps determine the appropriate investment options based on the timeframe associated with each goal. No goal is too small or too big; what may be significant for one person might be considered minor for another.
2.	Big Picture: Often, individuals have goals and plans, but they fail to align them cohesively. It is crucial to recognize that all goals are interconnected and have an impact on one another. For instance, you cannot invest in a tax-saving product without considering the lock-in period if liquidity is more important than saving taxes. Similarly, it is impractical to make new investments without considering existing investments and their relationship with one another. Taking a comprehensive view of all your investments helps prioritize your objectives and guides your investment decisions accordingly.
3.	Personal Finance: The word "personal" in personal finance holds significant importance. Every individual is unique, with distinct reasons and priorities for saving and investing. It is crucial to understand that replicating someone else's portfolio, be it a friend, colleague, or family member, may not align with your personal goals. Each person's financial journey is different, and their investment decisions should be tailored to their specific circumstances. For one person, building a retirement fund might be a top priority, while for another, it might be more important to focus on repaying loans. By recognizing the personal aspect of personal finance, you can make investment choices that align with your own goals and aspirations.

By considering these three key elements—goal/objective, the big picture, and personal finance—you can make more informed investment decisions that align with your unique circumstances and help you achieve your financial objectives.
